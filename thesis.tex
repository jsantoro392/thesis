\chapter{Introduction}

	More than 100 years ago, Albert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves,
	on the basis of his theory of general relativity.  
	Einstein predicted that the motion of two bodies, such as planets or stars—orbit each other,
	could cause distortions of space-time, gravitational waves.
	These ripples in the fabric of space-time would spread out like the ripples in a pond when a stone is tossed in,
	although their amplitude would be so small that it would be nearly impossible to detect by any technology foreseen at that time.
	It was also predicted that objects moving in an orbit would lose energy for this reason 
	(a consequence of the law of conservation of energy), as some energy would be given off as gravitational waves, 
	although this would be insignificantly small in all but the most extreme cases. 

	Gravitational waves squeeze and stretch anything in their path as they pass by.
	The most powerful gravitational waves are created when objects move at very high speeds. 
	Examples of such things are orbiting pairs of black holes and neutron stars, 
	or massive stars blowing up at the ends of their lives.
	There are four categories of gravitational waves based on what generates them: 
	continuous, compact binary inspiral, stochastic, and burst. 	
	Each category of objects generates a unique or characteristic set of signal 
	that LIGO-Virgo's interferometers can sense, and that researchers can look for in LIGO-Virgo’s data. \\
        The interferometers are designed to detect a specified range of frequencies of gravitational waves,
        which means that they cannot detect objects orbiting at rates that fall outside of this range of frequencies 
        (either too low or too high). \\ 
	During the final moments of the merger of two compact objects such as neutron stars 
	or black holes the emission of gravitational waves is at its peak. The binary loses energy, 
	largely through gravitational waves, and as a result, the two compact objects spiral in towards each other, 
	reaching extreme velocities at the very end of this process. 
	In the final fraction of a second of their merger a significant amount of their mass is converted into gravitational energy, 
	and travel outward as gravitational waves, that potentially fall within the detector’s sensitive range. 
 
	However, the time they spend orbiting in that range of frequencies is typically very brief.
        The masses of the objects involved dictate how long they emit detectable gravitational waves. 
        Heavy objects, like black holes, move through their final inspiral phase much more rapidly than 'lighter' objects, 
        like neutron stars. This means that black-hole merger signals are much shorter than neutron star merger signals.
        For example, the first detection of a gravitational wave signal, GW150914, coming from the a pair of merging black holes, 
	produced a signal just two-tenths of a second long. \\
        In contrast, the first neutron star merger LIGO detected in August 2017 generated a signal over 100 seconds long.
	This first observation was a a remarkable accomplishment: it demonstrated both the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems, 
	and the fact that such mergers could occur within the current age of the universe.  
	It also confirmed the last remaining unproven prediction of general relativity and validated 
	its predictions of space-time distortion in the context of large scale cosmic events. 
	Prior to this first detection, gravitational waves had only been inferred indirectly,
        via their effect on the timing of pulsars in binary star systems.
	This event  marked the beginning of a new era of gravitational-wave astronomy, 
	which would enable observations of violent astrophysical events that were not previously possible, 
	and potentially allow the direct observation of the birth of the universe.

\chapter{Gravitational Wave Detection Principles}
\section{Gravitational waves in linearized gravity}

	In 1915, Albert Einstein presented his general theory of relativity
	The classical Newtonian notion of gravity, which stated that gravity arises from an 
	action at a distance, was replaced by a geometric interpretation of the Universe, 
	the spacetime continuum: this may be regarded as a fabric and that can be curved 
	by mass. 
	The motion of masses on this curved spacetime fabric will then be perceived as gravity. \\

	In general relativity, space-time is regarded as a four-dimensional manifold 
	with a Lorentzian metric, and gravity is a manifestation of the manifold’s curvature. 
	The spacetime curvature is associated with the stress-energy tensor 
	of matter fields through the Einstein field equation:

		\begin{equation}
		G_{\mu\nu} \equiv R_{\mu\nu}  - {1 \over 2}g_{\mu\nu}R = {8\pi G_{N} \over {c^4}}T_{\mu\nu} 
		\end{equation}

	$G_{\mu\nu} $ is the Einstein tensor, $T_{\mu\nu} $ is the stress-energy 
	tensor of matter-fields and $ G_{N}$ is Newton’s gravitational constant. 

	In 1916 Einstein found the weak-field solutions to general relativity had wave-like solutions, gravitational waves.
	Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime, 
	which periodically lengthen and shorten space, and speed up and slow down time.
 	To study the properties of gravitational waves, it is instructive to first study them 
	in situations where the gravitational fields are weak.
	In the so-called weak-field approximation, one can view the metric as the Minkowski metric 
	with a small perturbation: the Einstein equations around the flat-space metric, of special relativity.
	Letting $ x_\mu = (t, x, y, z)$ denote the time and space coordinates, 
	we can write the proper distance between events $x_{\mu}$ and $x_{\mu} + dx_{\mu}$ as
		
		\[
		ds^2 = g_{\mu\nu}dx^{\mu}dx^{\nu} \approx (\eta_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu})dx_{\mu}dx_{\nu}. \hspace*{2cm}\|h_{\mu\nu}\|\ll 1
		\]
	Here $\eta_{\mu\nu} = diag(-1,1,1,1)$ is the usual Minkowski metric and $h_{\mu\nu}$ 
	represents the linearised gravitational field, it encapsulates gravitational waves, 
	but contains additional, non-radiative degrees of freedom as well. $\|h_{\mu\nu}\|$ means
	“the magnitude of a typical non-zero component of $h_{\mu\nu}$”. 
	The condition $\|h_{\mu\nu}\|\ll 1$ requires both the gravitational field to be weak, 
	and constrains the coordinate system to be approximately Cartesian.  
	In linearized gravity, the smallness of the perturbation means that only terms which are linear in $h_{\mu\nu}$ are considered;
	higher order terms are discarded. As a consequence, indices are raised and lowered using the flat metric. \\
	The metric perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}$ transforms as a tensor under Lorentz transformations, 
	but not under general coordinate transformations: since the numerical values of the components
	of a tensor depend on the reference frame, there exists a reference frame in which 
	the linearisation of the gravitational field holds on a sufficiently large region of the spacetime. \\
	The Einstein field equations are covariant under general coordinate transformations

		\begin{equation}
		x^{\mu} \rightarrow x^{\mu ‘}(x)
		\end{equation}
	So that the metric transforms as

		\begin{equation}
		g_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow g_{\mu' \nu'} = x^{\rho},_{\mu'}x^{\sigma},_{\nu'}g_{\rho \sigma}
		\end{equation}

	This means that one is free to choose a convenient coordinate system without 
	altering the physical predictions of the field equations.
	Choosing a reference frame breaks the invariance of general relativity under 
	coordiante trasformations but it also erases spurious degrees of freedom. \\
	After choosing a frame where the field is linearised, 
	a residual gauge symmetry remains. \\
	Under infinitesimal coordinate transformations
                 \[
		x_{\mu} \rightarrow x_{\mu} + \xi_{\mu}
                \]

	using the transformation law of the metric, to lowest order $h_{\mu\nu}$ transforms as
			
		\[
		h_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow h_{\mu\nu} - \partial_{\mu}\xi_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu}\xi_{\mu}
		\]

	Rather than working with the metric perturbation, changing notation and using the trace-reversed perturbation 
	makes the computation more compact and cleaner. We define
	
		\begin{equation}
		{\bar h}_{\mu\nu} = h_{\mu\nu} - {1 \over {2}}\eta_{\mu\nu}h  
		\end{equation}

	the trace
	
		\begin{equation}
		h = \eta^{\mu\nu}h_{\mu\nu}
		\end{equation}

	and express the trace-reversed field:

		\begin{equation}
		h_{\mu\nu} = {\bar h}_{\mu\nu} + {1 \over {2}}\eta_{\mu\nu}{\bar h}
		\end{equation}

	The Rienmann tensor constructed in the linearised theory is given by

		\begin{align}
		R^{\mu}_{\nu\rho\sigma} &= \partial_{\rho} \Gamma^{\mu}_{\nu\sigma} - \partial_{\sigma}\Gamma^{\mu}_{\nu\rho}  \\
				       &= {1 \over 2} (\partial_{\rho}\partial_{\nu}h^{\mu}_{\nu\rho} + \partial_{\sigma}\partial^{\mu}h^{\nu\rho} - \partial_{\rho}\partial^{\mu}h^{\nu\sigma} - \partial_{\					     \sigma}\partial_{\nu}h^{\mu}_{\rho})
		\end{align}

	From this, the Ricci tensor takes the form

		\begin{equation}
		R_{\mu\nu} = R^{\rho}_{\mu\rho\nu} = {1 \over 2}(\partial_{\rho}\partial_{\nu}h^{\rho}_{\mu} + \partial^{\rho}\partial_{\mu}h_{\nu\rho} - \square h_{\mu\nu} - \partial_{\mu}\partial_{\nu}h)
		\end{equation}

	The curvature scalar is obtained contracting once more:

		\begin{equation}
		R = R^{\mu}_{\mu} = (\partial_{\rho}\partial^{\mu}h^{\rho}_{\mu} - \square h)
		\end{equation}

	Finally, the Einstein tensor can be expressed as
	
		\begin{equation}
		G_{\mu\nu} = {1 \over 2}(\partial_{\rho}\partial_{\nu}h^{\rho}_{\mu} + \partial^{\rho}\partial_{\mu}h_{\nu\rho} - \square h_{\mu\nu} - \partial_{\mu}\partial_{\nu}h - \eta_{\mu\nu}\partial_{\rho}\partial^{\sigma}h^{\rho}_{\sigma} + \eta_{\mu\nu}\square h)
		\end{equation}

	Substituting the metric perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}$  with the $trace-reversed$ perturbation ${\bar h}_{\mu\nu}$ and expanding, 
	the linerised Einstein equations take the  compact form:

		\begin{equation}
		\square {\bar h}_{\mu\nu} + \eta_{\mu\nu}{\partial}^{\rho}{\partial}^{\sigma}{\bar h}_{\rho\sigma} - {\partial}^{\rho}{\partial}^{\nu}{\bar h}_{\mu\rho} - {\partial}^{\rho}{\partial}^{\mu}{\bar h}_{\nu\rho} = - {{16\pi G_{N}} \over {c^4}}T_{\mu\nu}.
		\end{equation}

	The linearised equations of motion are gauge-invariant, and the gauge freedom can
 	be used to simplify the form of the field equations.
 	In the Lorentz family of gauges, choosing the harmonic gauge $ \partial_{\mu}h_{\mu\nu} = 0 $, 
	reduces the Einstein equations to a simple wave equation that relates the trace-reversed field
 	to the stress energy tensor:

		\begin{equation}
		\square {\bar h}_{\mu\nu} =({\partial^2 \over {\partial t^2} } - {\partial^2 \over {\partial x^2}}  - {\partial^2 \over {\partial y^2}}  -  {\partial^2 \over {\partial z^2}}) {\bar h}_{\mu\nu} = -{{16\pi G_{N}} \over {c^4}}T_{\mu\nu}. 
		\end{equation}

	By imposing the harmonic gauge one has chosen the coordinates in such a way that for a single plane wave 
	(or a superposition of plane waves with their wave vectors pointing in the same direction),
	the gravitational wave  polarisations are perpendicular to the direction of propagation.

	The harmonic gauge gives four conditions, that reduce the ten indipendent components of  
	$h_{\mu\nu}$ to six indipendent components, so it does not fix the gauge completely,
	leaving four additional components free to be gauge-fixed.
	If the metric perturbation is not in the harmonic gauge, by making an infinitesimal coordinate transformation

		\begin{equation}
		{\bar h}_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow {\bar h}_{\mu’\nu’}  = {\bar h}_{\mu\nu}  - \xi_{\mu,\nu} -\xi_{\nu,\mu} + \eta_{\mu\nu}\xi^{\rho}_{,\rho}
		\end{equation}

	and applying the harmonic gauge condition

		\begin{equation}
		{\bar h}_{\mu’\nu’,} ^{\nu’} = {\bar h}_{\mu\nu,} ^{\nu} - \xi_{\mu,\nu}^{\nu}
		\end{equation}

	Therefore any metric perturbation can be put into an harmonic gauge by making an infinitesimal 
	coordinate transformation that satisfies

		\begin{equation}
		{\bar h}_{\mu\nu,} ^{\nu} = \xi_{\mu,\nu}^{\nu}
		\end{equation}

	This is a wave equation that always admits a solution, thus one can always achieve the harmonic gauge. \\
	Outside the source where $T_{\mu\nu} = 0$

		\begin{equation}
		\square {\bar h}_{\mu\nu} = 0
		\end{equation}

	In vacuum spacetimes which are asymptotically flat ($h_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow 0$ as $r \rightarrow 0$), 
	along with choosing the harmonic gauge, the metric perturbation can be greatly simplified using
	the residual gauge freedom within the harmonic gauge class. \\
	The transverse-traceless gauge, $TT$-gauge, can be obtained by choosing the components of the metric tensor $h_{\mu\nu}$,
	so that only the ones on the plane orthogonal to the direction of propagation (transverse) 
	are different from zero, this results in $h_{\mu\nu}$ being traceless:

		\begin{equation}
		h^{0\mu} = 0 \hspace*{0.5cm}  h^{i}_i = 0  \hspace*{0.5cm}   {\partial}^jh_{ij} = 0
		\end{equation}

	By imposing the harmonic gauge, the 10 degrees of freedom of the symmetric matrix $h_{\mu\nu}$ 
	have reduced to six degrees of freedom, and the residual gauge freedom,
	associated to the four function $\xi^{\mu}$, has further reduced these to just two degrees of freedom, 
	which corrispond to the two possible polarization states of the gravitational wave. \\
	Equation (2.17) has plane wave solutions, $h_{\mu\nu}^{TT}(x)=e_{ij}(k)e^{ikx}$ with 
	$k^{\mu}=(w/c,k)$ and $w/c=|k|$. The tensor $e_{ij}(k)$ is called the polarization tensor. \\

	In vacuum spacetimes, a plane gravitational wave with a given wave-vector $k$ is characterized 
	by two functions $h_+$ and $h_{\times}$, while the remaining components can be set to zero by
	choosing the transverse-traceless gauge. \\
	Choosing $n$ along the z axis:

		\begin{equation} 
		h_{\mu\nu}^{TT} = 
		\begin{bmatrix}
		0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & h_{+} & h_{\times} & 0 \\
		0 & h_{\times} & -h_{+} & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 0 
		\end{bmatrix}cos[w(t-z/c)]
		\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Geodesic equation and geodesic deviation}

	The usual notion of “gravitational force” disappears in general relativity, replaced instead 
	by the idea that freely falling bodies follow geodesics in spacetime.
	Geodesics are the curved-space equivalents of straight lines, which can be found by 
	parallel transporting the tangent vector of a curve.
	Given a spacetime metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ and a set of spacetime coordinates $x^{\mu}$, 
	geodesic trajectories are given by the equation:

		\begin{equation}
		{{d^2x^{\mu}}\over{d\tau^2}} + \Gamma_{\nu\rho}^{\mu}(x){{dx^{\nu}}\over{d\tau}}{{dx^{\rho}}\over{d\tau}} = 0 \hspace*{2cm} m \neq 0
		\end{equation}

		\begin{equation}
		{{d^2x^{\mu}}\over{d\lambda^2}} + \Gamma_{\nu\rho}^{\mu}(x){{dx^{\nu}}\over{d\lambda}}{{dx^{\rho}}\over{d\lambda}} = 0 \hspace*{2cm} m = 0
		\end{equation}

	which is the classical equation of motion of a test mass in the curved background described 
	by the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$, in the absence of external non gravitational force and where $m$ is the mass
	of the object, $\tau$ represents the proper time given by $d\tau^2 = -ds^2$, 
	and $\lambda$ is some affine parameter on the geodesic.
	In a flat spacetime, two straight lines that are initially parallel to each other will remain parallel. \\
	In a curved spacetime, geodesics do not satisfy this property.
	Instead, two nearby geodesics, separeted by $\zeta^{\mu}$, follow the geodesic deviation equation
		
		\begin{equation}
		{{D^2\zeta^{\mu}}\over{D\tau^2}} = -R^{\mu}_{\nu\rho\sigma}\zeta^{\rho}{{dx^{\nu}}\over{d\tau}}{{dx^{\sigma}}\over{d\tau}}
		\end{equation}

	where $D/D\tau$ is defined as

		\begin{equation}
		{{DV^{\mu}}\over{D\tau}} \equiv {{dV^{\mu}}\over{d\tau}} + \Gamma^{\mu}_{\nu\rho}V^{\nu}{{dx^{\rho}}\over{d\tau}}
		\end{equation}

	and denotes the covariant derivative along a curve that is parameterised by $\tau$. 
	The geodesic deviation equation describes the change in separation $\zeta^{\mu}$ between two nearby geodesic.
	As the Rienmann tensor describes the tidal forces caused by the gravitational field, 
	the geodesic deviation equation shows that these tidal forces can be considered as deviations of nearby geodesics.

\subsection{Interaction of Gravitational waves with test masses}

	To understand how gravitational waves interact with the detectors, mirrors in the case of the interferometric detectors, 
	it's necessary to use the geodesic equation and the geodesic deviation equation, which are also important tools 
	for understanding the physical meaning of a given gauge choice. \\
	In fact the physics must be invariant under coordinate trasformations but GWs and the detector description's depend on the chosen reference frame.

\subsubsection{Transverse-traceless gauge}
	Gravitational waves take a particularly simple form in the $TT$-gauge 
	and choosing a gauge is equivalent to selecting a reference frame. 
	Consider a test mass initially at rest at $\tau = 0$. The geodesic equation then becomes

		\begin{equation}
		{{dx^i}\over{d\tau^2}} = -[\Gamma^i_{\nu\rho}{{dx^{\nu}}\over{d\tau}}{{dx^{\rho}}\over{d\tau}}]_{\tau=0} \\ 
		= - [ \Gamma^i_{00}({{dx^0}\over{d\tau}})^2]_{\tau=0}
		\end{equation}

	by assumption
		
		\begin{equation}
		{{dx^i}\over{d\tau}} = 0 \hspace*{2cm} at \hspace*{0.5cm}\tau = 0
		\end{equation}

	since the mass is initially at rest. Expanding to first order in $h_{\mu\nu}$, 
	the Christoffel symbol $\Gamma^i_{00}$ vanishes in the TT gauge

		\begin{equation}
		\Gamma^i_{00} = {1 \over {2}}(2\partial_{0}h_{0i} - \partial_i h_{00})
		\end{equation}

	because both $h_{00}$ and $h_{0i}$ are set to zero by the gauge condition. 
	Therefore, if at time $\tau = 0$, $dx^i/d\tau$ is zero, remains zero at all times, 
	because its derivatives also vanishes. \\
	This shows that if two test masses are initially separated by a coordinate separation of $x^i$ in the TT frame, 
	and are at rest with respect to each other, they will remain at this separation. \\
	Overall, it seems that a GW has no influence on the geodesic or on the deviation of geodesics.
	In other words, in the TT gauge the coordinate location of a slowly moving, freely falling body is unaffected 
	by the GW because the coordinates move with the waves.
	The TT gauge illustrates that, in general relativity, the physical effects are not expressed by what happens 
	to the coordinates since the theory is invariant under coordinate transformations:
	the position of test masses doesn't change because the freedom of gauge allowed to define the coordinates 
	in such a way that they don't change.
	Physical effects can instead be found monitoring proper distances, or proper times.

	In fact the GWs cause the proper separation between two freely falling particles to oscillate, 
	even if the coordinate separation is constant. Consider two spatial freely falling particles, 
	located at $z = 0$, and separated on the x axis by a coordinate distance $L_c$. \\
	Consider a GW in TT gauge that propagates down the z axis, $h^{TT}_{\mu\nu}(t,z)$. 
	The proper distance L between the two particles in the presence of the GW is given by

		\begin{align}
		L & = \int^{L_c}_{0}{dx\sqrt{g_{xx}}} = \int^{L_c}_{0}dx\sqrt{1 + h^{TT}_{xx}(t,z=0)} \\
		& \simeq \int^{L_c}_{0}{dx[1 + {1 \over 2}h^{TT}_{xx}(t,z=0)]} \\
		&= L_c[1 + {1 \over 2}h^{TT}_{xx}(t,z=0)]
		\end{align}

	Therefore, the proper distance expands and shrinks periodically,with a fractional length change $\delta L/L$ given by

		\begin{equation}
		{{\delta L}\over{L}} \simeq {1 \over 2} h_{xx}^{TT}(t,z=0)
		\end{equation}

	Even though this result is calculated in the TT gauge, it is indeed gauge indipendent;
	$h_{xx}^{TT}$ acts as a strain, a fractional length change.
	Because the time that light travels between the two test masses is related to the proper distance,  
	which directly relates to the accumulated phase measured by laser interferometric GW observatories,
	GWs leave an imprint on the time it takes for a photon to make a round trip. 
	Consequently, interferometers can potentially measure these imprints by measuring the length difference between
	their arms. The “extra” phase $\delta \phi$ (if $L \ll \lambda$ so that the metric perturbation 
	does not change value very much during a light travel time) accumulated by a photon that travels
	down and back the arm of a laser interferometer in the presence of a GW is $\delta \phi = 4\pi \delta L \lambda$, 
	where $\lambda$ is the photon’s wavelength and $\delta L$ is the distance
	the end mirror moves relative to the beam splitter.


\subsubsection{Local proper reference frame}

	Since positions in a lab are not marked by test particles,  
	the $TT$ frame is not very practical. 
	The preferred reference frame is the proper detector frame 
	in which the test particle is free to move because of a passing gravitational wave. 
	The path of a test particle can then be described by Newtonian equations of motion in terms of forces. 
	There are terms proportional to the Riemann curvature tensor from the gravitational field of the Earth 
	but also terms from static gravitational forces, Coriolis forces, etc. 
	In order to leave only the part proportional to the Riemann tensor, 
	earth-based detectors look for higher frequency gravitational waves, 
	as gravitational waves with low frequencies are comparable with slowly varying Newtonian noises. 
	The acceleration in the $z$-direction due to Earth’s gravity can be dealt with suspension systems 
	allowing the test mass to act as if they were in a freely falling frame in the $x - y$ plane. 

	Consider a detector capable of measuring changes in the proper distance, e.g. an interferometer, 
	with a characteristic size that is much smaller than the characteristic wavelength of the GW.
	In this case, one can approximate the entire detector to be in a near local Lorentz frame  
	(freely falling frame), even in the presence of GWs. This coordinate system is defined by the requirements

		\begin{equation}
		z^i(\tau) = 0, \hspace*{2cm} g_{ab}(t, 0) = \eta_{ab}, \hspace*{2cm} \Gamma^a_{bc}(t,0) = 0,
		\end{equation}

	which imply that the metric has the form

		\begin{equation}
		ds^2 \approx -dt^2 + \delta_{ij}dx^i dx^j + O({{x^ix^j}\over{L^2_B}})
		\end{equation}

	where $L^2_B$ denotes the typical variation scale of the metric.
	Consider now the proper distance between the two geodesics, $\zeta^i$, 
	to understand how the GWs influence these two test masses the geodesic deviation equation is calculated as

		\begin{equation}
		{{d^2\zeta^{\mu}}\over{d\tau^2}} + 2\Gamma^{\mu}_{\nu\rho}{{dx^{\nu}}\over{d\tau}}{{dx^\rho}\over{d\tau}} + \zeta^{\sigma}\Gamma^{\mu}_{\nu\rho,\sigma}{{dx^{\nu}}\over{d\tau}}{{dx^{\rho}}\over{d\tau}} = 0
		\end{equation}

	Assuming the two test masses are moving non-relativistically, $dx^i/d\tau$ can be neglected compared to $dx^0/d\tau$.
	Furthermore, the term proportional to $\Gamma^{\mu}_\nu\rho{}$ is negligible compared to other terms in a near LLF. Hence,

		\begin{equation}
		{{d^2\zeta^{\mu}}\over{d\tau^2}} + \zeta^{\sigma}\Gamma^{i}_{00, \sigma}({{dx^0}\over{d\tau}})^2 = 0
		\end{equation}

	Further simplifying $\zeta^{\sigma}\Gamma^{i}_{00, \sigma} \approx \zeta^{j}\Gamma^{i}_{00, j}$

		\begin{equation}
		{{d^2\zeta^{\mu}}\over{d\tau^2}} + \zeta^{j}\Gamma^{i}_{00,j}({{dx^0}\over{d\tau}})^2 = 0
		\end{equation}

	But in the LLF, $R^i_{0j0} = \Gamma^i_{00,j} - \Gamma^i_{0j,0} = \Gamma^i_{00,j}$ and therefore

		\begin{equation}
		{{d^2\zeta^{\mu}}\over{d\tau^2}} + R^i_{0j0} \zeta^j({{dx^0}\over{d\tau}})^2 = 0
		\end{equation}

	Because $dx^0/d\tau \approx 1$, one can approximate $\tau \approx t$:

		\begin{equation}
		{\ddot \zeta}^j = - R^i_{0j0}\zeta^j
		\end{equation}
	
	The key quantity entering into the equation, the Rienmann tensor, is gauge invariant in linearized theory, 
	it can be evaluated in any convenient coordinate system.
	The expression for the Rienmann tensor in terms of the TT gauge metric perturbation $h_{ij}^{TT}$

		\begin{equation}
		R^i_{0j0} = R_{i0j0} = - {1 \over 2}{\ddot h}_{ij}^{TT}
		\end{equation}

	Substituting into the previous equation, the geodesic deviation equation in the proper detector frame takes the form

		\begin{equation}
		{\ddot \zeta}^i = {1 \over 2}{\ddot h}_{ij}^{TT}\zeta^j
		\end{equation}

	which can be interpreted as if the influence of a GW in a near LLF resembles a Newtonian force.
	In general directions, the proper distance is given by

		\begin{equation}
		s = \sqrt{L^2 + h_{ij}(t)L_{i}L_{j}}
		\end{equation}

	where $L_i$ denotes the spatial separation between two test masses and $L$ the associated coordinate distance.
	In the given metric for the proper reference frame, the proper distance is just $|L| = \sqrt{L_iL_j}$ up to fractional errors; 
	since the only detectors taken in consideration are those
	with $L \ll \lambda$, these errors are smaller than the fractional distance changes caused by the GW.
	Therefore $|L|$ is simply identified as the proper separation. The ideal equation for analyzing an interferometric GW detector is

		\begin{equation}
		{\ddot L}^i = {1 \over 2}{\ddot h}_{ij}^{TT}L^j
		\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Ring of test masses}

	The effects of gravitational waves cannot be seen in isolated bodies. 
	This is a result of the fact that a single test mass, in a frame freely falling with it, 
	will remain at rest. At least two test masses are required to measure the effects of gravitational waves. 
	This is also the case when one wants to measure any curvature of spacetime.
	Consider a ring of test masses in the $(x, y)$ plane of a proper detector frame, initially at rest, centred at $z = 0$, 
	and a GW travelling in the $z$-direction.
	This situation restricts the attention to the $(x,y)$ plane alone, because $h_{ij}^{TT}$ is transverse to the propagation direction, 
	so the GW will only have influence in the plane of the test masses:
	the only non zero compontents of the metric perturbation are

		\begin{equation}
		h_{xx}^{TT} = - h_{yy}^{TT} = h_{+} \hspace*{3cm} h_{xy}^{TT} = h_{yx}^{TT} = h_{\times}
		\end{equation}

	where $h_{+}(t-z)$ and $h_{\times}(t-z)$ are the two polarization components, which are indipendent and can be considered separately.
	For the plus polarization at $z=0$ and initial conditions $h_{ij}^{TT} = 0$ at $t=0$:

		\begin{equation}
		h_{ab}^{TT} = 
		\begin{bmatrix}
		1  & 0 \\
		0 &  -1 \\
		\end{bmatrix} 
		h_{+}\cos \omega t
		\end{equation}

	If the displacement between geodesics is $\zeta_a (t) = (x_0 + \delta x(t), y_0 + \delta y(t))$, then of $\zeta_a (t)$ is

		\begin{equation}
		\delta {\ddot x} = - {{h_{+}} \over 2} (x_0 + \delta x) \omega ^2 \sin \omega t
		\end{equation}

		\begin{equation}
		\delta {\ddot y} =  {{h_{+}} \over 2} (y_0 + \delta y) \omega ^2 \sin \omega t
		\end{equation}

	Assuming that the perturbations are $O(h)$, and thus small compared to the unperturbed locations, $\delta x$ and $\delta y$ can be neglected.
	The integrations gives the deviations caused by the plus polarisations:

		\begin{equation}
		\delta x(t) =  {{h_{+}} \over 2} x_0 \sin \omega t
		\end{equation}

		\begin{equation}
		\delta y(t) = - {{h_{+}} \over 2} y_0  \sin \omega t
		\end{equation}

	Similarly, for the cross polarization at $z=0$ and initial conditions $h_{ij}^{TT} = 0$ at $t= 0$, the situation is described by the equations
		
		\begin{equation}
		\delta x(t) =  {{h_{\times}} \over 2} y_0 \sin \omega t
		\end{equation}

		\begin{equation}
		\delta y(t) =  {{h_{\times}} \over 2} x_0  \sin \omega t
		\end{equation}
		
	This set of equations describes the changes in the x and y components for a passing gravitational wave.
	The plus polarization alternately stretches and compresses the ring of test masses in the x and y directions, 
	while the cross polarization exhibits the same behavior rotated by $\ang{45}$ in the x - y plane.

\subsection{Beam pattern functions}

        Interferometers are sensitive to the relative difference between two distances, the so-called strain.
        Suppose we have an interferometer with its arms pointing along the unit vectors $u^i$ and $v^i$. The strain $h(t)$ is given by

                \begin{equation}
                h(t) = {1 \over 2} (h_{ij}u^iu^j - h_{ij}v^iv^j) = D^{ij}h_{ij}(t)
                \end{equation}

        where $D^{ij}$ is referred to as the detector tensor and is given by

                \begin{equation}
                D^{ij} = {1\over 2} (u^iu^j -v^iv^j)
                \end{equation}

        As the expression for $h(t)$ is linear in $h_{+}$ and $h_{\times}$, one can also write

                \begin{equation}
                h(t) = F_{+}h_{+} (t) + F_{\times}h_{\times}(t)
                \end{equation}

        where $F_{+,\times}$ are called the beam pattern functions. Suppose we have a detector
        with arms that are perpendicular to each other, one pointing in the x-direction and the other
        in the $y$-direction in a Cartesian coordinate system. This detector frame, denoted by $(x,y,z)$,
        is generally different from the GW coordinate system, denoted by $(x^\prime,y^\prime,z^\prime)$, where the source
        is conveniently described. To account for such a difference, we first note that when the plus
        and cross polarisations are not equal in strength, we can rotate the coordinate system by
        an angle $\psi$ around the $z^\prime$ axis so that the $x^\prime$ and $y^\prime$ axes
        coincide with the mayor and minor axis of the associated ellipse.
        In going from the GW frame to the detector frame, we can rotate the GW frame by
        an angle $\theta$ around the $x^\prime$ axis and an angle $\phi$ around the $z^\prime$ axis,
        where the angles $(\theta, \phi)$ denote the direction of propagation of the GW in the detector frame.
        Applying these three rotations, the beam pattern functions for a detector with perpendicular arms are given by

                \begin{align}
                F_{+}^{\ang{90}}& = {1 \over 2} (1 + \cos^2 \theta)\cos 2\phi \cos 2 \psi - \cos \theta \sin2\phi \sin2\psi \\
                F_{\times}^{\ang{90}}& = {1 \over 2} (1 + \cos^2 \theta)\cos 2\phi \sin 2 \psi + \cos \theta \sin2\phi \cos2\psi
                \end{align}

\section{Gravitational Wave Interferometry}

	The generation and propagation of gravitational and electromagnetic radiation are basically quite similar but, 
	on a more practical level, gravitational and electromagnetic waves are quite different.
	First of all, electromagnetic waves interact strongly with matter, while gravitational waves travel unperturbed through space, 
	as they interact only very weakly with matter. This makes possible to probe astrophysics that is hidden or dark 
	to electromagnetic observations, such as the coalescence and merger of black holes, the collapse of a stellar core, 
	the dynamics of the early Universe. It also means that detecting gravitational waves is very difficult. \\
	Electromagnetic radiation typically has a wavelength smaller than the size of the emitting system, 
	and so can be used to form an image of the source, while the wavelength of gravitational radiation is typically comparable 
	to or larger than the size of the radiating source. \\
	Gravitational waves are generated by the bulk dynamics of the source itself so they cannot be used to form an image: 
	the radiation simply does not resolve the generating system. 
	In most cases, electromagnetic astronomy is based on observers obtain a large amount of information about sources on a small piece 
	of the sky while gravitational wave astronomy is all-sky research.
	Detectors have nearly $4\pi$ steradian sensitivity to events over the sky. This means that any source on the sky will be detectable, 
	not just sources towards which the detector is pointed. 

	Gravitational radiation is produced by oscillating multipole moments of the mass distribution of a system. 
	Quadrupole radiation is the lowest allowed form, and is thus usually the dominant form. 
	In this case, the gravitational wave field strength is proportional to the second time derivative of the quadrupole moment of the source, 
	and it falls off in amplitude $h$, the direct observable of gravitational radiation, with distance as $1/r$. 
	This comparatively slow fall off with radius means that relatively small improvements in the sensitivity 
	of gravitational wave detectors can have a large impact on their science:
	doubling the sensitivity of a detector doubles the distance to which sources can be detected, 
	increasing the volume of the Universe to which sources are measurable. \\ 
	The oscillating quadrupolar strain pattern of a gravitational wave is well matched by a Michelson interferometer, 
	which makes a very sensitive comparison of the lengths of its two orthogonal arms. 
	Multiple detectors at separated sites are crucial for rejecting instrumental and environmental artifacts in the data, 
	by requiring coincident detections in the analysis. 


	Also, because the antenna pattern of an interferometer is quite wide, 
	source localisation requires triangulation using three separated detectors: 
	the direction of travel of the GWs and the complete polarisation information carried by the waves can only be extracted by a network of detectors. 
	The challenge is to make the instrument sufficiently sensitive: 
	at the targeted strain sensitivity of $10^{−21}$ m, the resulting arm length change is only $\tilde 10^{-18}$ m, 
	a thousand times smaller than the diameter of a proton. \\
	A key feature of the detectors is simply their scale: 
	the arms are made as long as practically possible to increase the signal due to a gravitational wave strain. 

\subsection{Laser Interferometers}

	For the many decades after they were predicted, direct observation of gravitational waves was not possible 
	due to the tiny effect that would need to be detected and separated from the background of vibrations present everywhere on Earth.
	A technique called interferometry was suggested in the 1960s and eventually technology developed  
	sufficiently for this technique to become achievable. \\
	The first gravitational wave detectors were resonant-mass cylindrical bar detectors, 
	developed and built by Joseph Weber in the 1960s. \\
	Over the course of the next several decades, more bar detectors were built that were at least 
	four orders of magnitude more sensitive than Weber’s original design, 
	These detectors would be set into oscillation at their resonant frequency by passing gravitational waves 
	near that resonant frequency and were sensitive to gravitational waves with relatively high frequency ($\sim$ 1 kHz) 
	and in a narrow frequency band. In order to detect signals in a broader range of frequencies and out to farther distances, 
	large-scale interferometric detectors have been built. \\ 
	The idea originated with the Russian theorists, M. Gertsenshtein and V. I. Pustovoit in 1962. 
	But the strong push for using interferometers came in the late 1960s with R. Forward, R. Weiss, 
	R. Drever, and others. From the early 2000s, several kilometer-scale ground-based interferometers 
	operated in the frequency band from 10 Hz to 1 kHz at a sensitivity that all
	owed the potential for detection from a variety of sources at large extragalactic distances.

	The gravitational wave detectors are power-recycled Fabry–Perot Michelson interferometers, 
	which offer the possibility of very high sensitivities over a wide range of frequency and 
	are particularly suited to the detection of local perturbations in the space–time metric from astrophysical sources.
	These distant sources, including binary black hole or neutron star coalescences, asymmetric rapidly spinning neutron stars, 
	and supernovae are expected to produce time-dependent strain $h(t)$ observable by the interferometer array.
	The optical layout of the detectors consists in perpendicular Fabry–Perot arm cavities of the Michelson, 
	composed of mirrors, which also serve as gravitational test masses, widely separated and 
	freely suspended as pendulums to isolate against seismic noise and reduce the effects of thermal noise.
	A beam splitter divides the incident laser beam into two equal components sent into the two arms of the interferometer. 
	In each arm, a two mirrors Fabry-Perot resonant cavity extends the optical length from 3 to about 100 kilometers, 
	because of multiple reflections and therefore increases the carrier power and phase shift for a given strain amplitude. 
	When the beams recombine, they will interfere constructively if the lengths of the two arms differ by an integral number 
	of wavelengths and interfere destructively if the lengths differ by an odd number of half wavelengths.
	The induced change in the length of the interferometer arms impresses a phase modulation on the 
	light observed at the interferometer output, which is proportional to the wave’s amplitude.
	Each interferometer uses a Nd:YAG laser  ($\lambda = 1064 nm$ or f = 282 THz).
	After phase modulation, the beam passes into the LIGO vacuum system. 
	All the main interferometer optical components and beam paths are enclosed in the ultra-high vacuum system 
	$(10^{−8} - 10^{−9} torr)$ for acoustical isolation and to reduce phase fluctuations from light scattering off residual gas. 
	The photodetectors are all located outside the vacuum system, mounted on optical tables. 
	The beam tubes are made from stainless steel and are designed to have low-outgassing 
	so that the required vacuum could be attained by pumping only from the ends of the tubes. 
	The interferometer optics, including the test masses, are manufactured to have extremely low scatter and low absorption.
	The two Fabry-Perot arms and power recycling cavities are essential to achieving the LIGO sensitivity goal, 
	but they require an active feedback system to maintain the interferometer at the proper operating point.

	The high frequency band, $1Hz \apprle f \apprle 10^4 Hz$, is targeted by 
	the new generation of ground-based laser interferometric detectors such as LIGO.
	The low frequency end of this band is set by the fact that it is extremely difficult 
	to prevent mechanical coupling of the detector to ground vibrations at low frequencies,
	and probably impossible to prevent gravitational coupling to ground vibrations, human activity, and atmospheric motions.
	The high end of the band is set by the fact that it is unlikely any interesting GW source 
	radiates at frequencies higher than a few kilohertz. Such a source would have to be relatively
	low mass $(\apprle 1M_{\odot})$ but extremely compact. \\
	There are no known theoretical or observational indications that gravitationally collapsed objects in this mass range exist.

%	The various noises of the detector can be conveniently characterized by a spectral strain
%	sensitivity with dimensions of $1/\sqrt{Hz}$.
%	The detector output $s(t)$ is composed of instrumental noise $n(t)$ arising from 
%	naturally occurring random processes and a potential strain signal $h(t)$
%
%		\begin{equation}
%		s(t) = n(t) + h(t)
%		\end{equation}
%
%	The detection problem then becomes how to distinguish $h(t)$ from $n(t)$ when $h(t) << n(t)$. 
%	In a way, $n(t)$ provides a measure of how small an $h(t)$ we can detect. 
%	Thus we take $n(t)$ as the detector’s noise and have a convenient way to 
%	compare performances of different detectors. 
%	Instrumental noise is a random process. In the case that we have a stationary 
%	random process (which can be the case for detector noise for short periods of time), 
%	the expectation value of $n$ at some time t becomes a long time average (as opposed to an ensemble average):
%
%		\begin{equation}
%		<n> = \lim_{T \to \infty} {1 \over T} \int^{T/2}_{-T/2}n(t)dt
%		\end{equation}
%
%	For simplicity, let us assume that $<n> = 0$. We can still define the power in the signal by 
%	integrating $n^2(t)$ over some duration $T$ and then dividing by $T$. 
%	Again, the expectation value of $n^2(t)$ will just be the time average:
%
%		\begin{equation}
%		<n^2> = \lim_{T \to \infty} {1 \over T} \int^{T/2}_{-T/2}n^2(t)dt
%		\end{equation}
%
%	If $n(t) = 0$ outside of $−T/2 < t < T/2$, then we can extend the integral limits to infinity
%	
%		\begin{equation}
%		\begin{split}
%		<n^2>  = \lim_{T \to \infty}{1 \over T}\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}n^2(t) dt \\
%         	       = \lim_{T \to \infty}{1 \over T} \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}|\tilde{n}(f)|^2df \\ 
%                       = \lim_{T \to \infty}{2 \over T} \int^{\infty}_{0}|\tilde{n}(f)|^2df \\
%                       = \int^{\infty}_{0}S_n(f)df
%		\end{split}
%		\end{equation}
%
%	where $S_n$ is what is known as the power spectral density of the noise process $n(t)$ 
%	and $\tilde{n}(f)$ is the Fourier transform of $n(t)$. 
%	Thus, in general, the power spectral density of a stationary random process $n(t)$ is defined as
%
%		\begin{equation}
%		= \lim_{T \to \infty}{2 \over T} |\int^{T/2}_{-T/2}n(t)e^{-2\pi ift}dt|^2
%		\end{equation}
%
%	Another useful expression for the power spectral density can be found by finding 
%	the expectation value of the frequency components of the noise
%
%		\begin{equation}
%		<\tilde{n}\ast(f\prime)\tilde{n}(f)>  = {1 \over 2} S_n(f) \delta (f-f\prime)
%		\end{equation}

%	Since the noise is real, $\tilde{n}(-f) = \tilde{n}(f)$ and thus, $S_n(−f) = Sn(f)$. 
%	If $n(t)$ has no dimensions, then $S_n(f)$ has units of $Hz^{-1}$.
% 	If $<\tilde{n}\ast(f\prime)\tilde{n}(f)> $ is obtained by integrating only over the physical
%	range of frequencies, $f > 0$, then $S_n(f)$ is known as the $one-sided spectral density$.
%	Finally, on further definition that will come in handy is the inner product of $a$ and $b$:
%
%
%		\begin{equation}
%		(a|b) = 2 \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} {{\tilde{a}(f)\tilde{b}\ast(f)} \over {S_n(f)}}df = 4 Re [\int^{\infty}_{0}{{\tilde{a}(f)\tilde{b}\ast(f)} \over {S_n(f)}} df]
%		\end{equation}
%

\subsubsection{Non-stationary transient noise sources}
	
	The various noises of the detector can be conveniently characterized by a spectral strain
        sensitivity with dimensions of $1/\sqrt{Hz}$.
        The detector output $s(t)$ is composed of instrumental noise $n(t)$ arising from
        naturally occurring random processes and a potential strain signal $h(t)$

                \begin{equation}
                s(t) = n(t) + h(t)
                \end{equation}

        The detection problem then becomes how to distinguish $h(t)$ from $n(t)$ when $h(t) << n(t)$.
        In a way, $n(t)$ provides a measure of how small an $h(t)$ we can detect.
        Thus we take $n(t)$ as the detector’s noise and have a convenient way to
        compare performances of different detectors.
	The instrument response $s(t)$ can be also expressed as a convolution of the antenna patterns 
	with the two gravitational wave polarizations $h_{+}, h_{\times}(t)$:
	
		\begin{equation}
		s(t) = n(t) +  F_{+}h_{+} (t) + F_{\times}h_{\times}(t)
		\end{equation} 

	The antenna patterns depend on the frequency and sky location of the source; 
	for wavelengths that are large compared to the detector, the antenna patterns are simple quadrupoles.
	The information contained in the time series is usually represented in the Fourier domain 
	as a strain amplitude spectral density, $h(f)$.
	This quantity is defined in terms of the power spectral density $S_s(f) = \tilde s^{*}(f) \tilde s(f)$
	of the Fourier transform of the time series:

		\begin{equation}
                \tilde s(f) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} e^{-2 \pi ift} s(t)dt
		\end{equation}

	The strain amplitude spectral density is then defined as $h(f) = \sqrt{S_s(f}$.
	The noise power spectral density $S_n(f)$ and the signal power spectral density $S_h(f)$.ù
  
	Noises are categorised as either a displacement noise, which directly moves the suspended mirrors
        causing a differential change in the arm cavity lengths, or as a sensing noise,
        which appears in the readout signal but is not caused by a gravitational wave. \\
        In this paragraph are described the principal noises that dominate the limits of our sensitivity.

                \begin{figure}
                        \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{noisetwo}
                        \centering
                        \caption{Noise budget}
                        \label{fig:noisetwo}
                \end{figure}

        At lower frequencies, up to 10Hz, the main contribute to the global noise
        is due to vibrations of the ground which couple to the mirror motion: it shakes the optics and produces strain signals that mask gravitational wave signals. \\
        This seismic noise could be caused by earthquakes, weather and human activity.
        To reduce the potential movements of the optical elements, an attempt is made to
        isolate the mirrors using an advanced suspension system. \\

        At frequencies where the seismic motion has been sufficiently reduced,
        between 10Hz and 500Hz, the random Brownian motion of the molecules on the surface of the mirrors and wires dominates. \\
    
        The thermal energy of the interferometer’s components induce vibrations both in the suspensions and in the mirrors.
        The nature of gravitational wave signal requires the sensitivity of the interferometric detectors
        to be extremely high in broad frequency band. \\
        Therefore, the power spectrum density of the thermal noise must be considered in the development of the detectors.
        The Fluctuation-dissipation Theorem (FDT) relates the spectrum of the thermal noise to the amount of dissipation

                \begin{equation}
                S_{n}(w) = - {{4k_bT} \over {w}} Im[H(w)]
                \end{equation}

        From this equation is possible to state that the energy of fluctuations has a frequency dependent distribution;
        $H(z)$ is the transfer function of the system, it is a mathematical function that models the device’s output, defined as

                \begin{equation}
                H(x) = {1 \over {iWZ(w)}}
                \end{equation}

        In which $Z(w)$ is the impedance of the system in the frequency domain that can be computed as the ratio
        between the Fourier components of the generalised force $\tilde F(w)$ and the response of the system $\tilde X(w)$

                \begin{equation}
                Z(w) = {{\tilde F(w)} \over {iw \tilde X(w)}}
                \end{equation}

        In the case of an harmonic oscillator, the noise spectral density is

                \begin{equation}
                S_n(w) = {{4k_bT} \over {mw}} {{{w_0}^2 \phi(w)} \over {(w^2-{w_0}^2)^2 + {w_0}^4 \phi^2(w)}}
		\end{equation} 

	Generally, thermal noise can be reduced decreasing the dissipation with monolithic suspensions and better coatings
        other than lowering the temperature using criogenic payloads as it will be done in Kagra and Einstein Telescope. \\
        Quantum mechanics limits the precision at which the test mass positions can be determined. 

        At high frequencies, photon shot noise limits the sensitivity, 
	while at low frequencies it is limited by radiation pressure.
        The photon shot noise is produced by the natural fluctuations in the rate of photons arriving at the photodiode,
        that follow a Poisson process. The noise will decrease with increasing laser power,
        recycling cavity gain, arm cavity gain, and arm length.
        The corresponding noise spectral density is

                \begin{equation}
                S_n(w) = ({{\lambda_{laser}} \over {4 \pi L}})^2 {{2 \hbar w_{laser}} \over {P}}
                \end{equation}

        Radiation pressure noise is associated with the photons from the laser striking the mirror
        and causing a force on the mirror. Of course, increasing the laser power to combat shot noise
        will actually result in an increase of radiation pressure.

                \begin{equation}
                S_n(w) =  {{32 \hbar w_{laser}P} \over {(4MLc \pi^2 f^2)^2}}
                \end{equation}

        This is an example of the Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, which says that the knowledge
        of the position and the momentum of a body is restricted from the relation $\delta x \delta p \geq \hbar$. \\
        The high laser power required to determine the position of the test masses exerts
        a fluctuating radiation pressure which perturbs the test mass positions. \\
        The minimun noise level is called Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) and sets a fundamental limit
        on the sensitivity of beam detectors, contributing to the noise as

                \begin{equation}
                S_n(w) = {{2 \hbar} \over {M(\pi f L)^2}}
                \end{equation}

        Moreover, the presence of residual gas in the beam tubes would worsen the performance
        of the mirrors and of the laser; for this reason the vacuum system is maintained at a pressure
        of below $10^{-6}$Pa and the noise curve of the interferometer includes only
        the most dominant residual gas component, hydrogen, at a pressure of $10^{−7}$ Pa. \\

\subsection{Sources}

	There are four different classes of physical sources 
	that are potential sources of gravitational waves 
	of sufficient amplitude to be detectable 
	by current or theorised gravitational wave detectors. 

\subsubsection{Coalescing compact binaries}

	Compact binary star systems, in which each member is a neutron star or black hole, 
	are currently the only observed sources of GWs. \\
	They are an ideal source for ground based GW detectors, 
	as their compactness allows their orbital separation to become 
	small enough before they merge for them to emit GWs in the detectors sensitive frequency band. \\
	If one of the components of the binary is a neutron star 
	then there may be an electromagnetic counterpart to the GW signal. \\
	The loss of energy from the system will cause the orbital radius to decay, 
	the frequency to increase, and the amplitude of the radiation to increase, 
	producing a distinctive chirp-like signal. 
	
	Eventually, the two objects will be close enough to merge together, 
	and the new single object will pulsate in an excite state as it tries to return to equilibrium. 
	This phase is known as the ringdown phase and it is well-modeled as a series of quasi-normal modes. \\ 
	As the form of the gravitational radiation can be predicted allows 
	a more sensitive search to be performed: knowing the form of the signal 
	that is being search for allows powerful matched filtering techniques 
	and signal consistency tests to be used in the attempt to detect such signals.


\subsubsection{Bursts}

	A burst of gravitational waves is an event that releases a large amount 
	of gravitational energy over a very short period of time, typically less than a few seconds. \\ 
	Astrophysical events that are believed to result in a transient signal 
	include gamma ray bursts and supernovae explosion as well as the final stages of a coalescing binary. \\
	GW signal with a partially modelled or unknown waveform, 
	this may be due to unknown or complicated physics, or the source may be something totally unpredicted. 

	The matched filtering is not a useful technique to search for this type of signal, 
	as the waveform of a GW burst signal is unknown. \\
	Searches for GW bursts typically search for excess power that occurs coherently between multiple detectors. \\ 
	Even with no knowledge of the source of a GW signal, 
	it is still possible to estimate some of the source parameters. \\
	Searches for GW bursts typically give estimations of the duration, 
	amplitude and frequency of the source. 
	An estimation of the sky position is given by measuring the difference 
	in arrival time between different detectors. \\
	If the distance to the source is known, 
	perhaps through an electromagnetic counterpart, 
	then it is possible to estimate the energy of the source. 


\subsubsection{Continuous Sources}

	A periodic source is a source that emits at constant or nearly constant frequency.
	The prototypical source of continuous GWs is high frequency rotating neutron stars 
	with a non-axial deformation or low frequency binary systems 
	composed of white dwarfs or black holes far from merger. \\
	These sources should be present throughout the operational lifetime of a detector, 
	so the greater the observation time, the better the sensitivity to periodic sources becomes. 

	Spinning neutron stars will lose energy and spin down over time, 
	and this energy loss is due to a number of different mechanisms, 
	including emission of gravitational radiation. \\
	To emit a continuous GW with characteristic amplitude, 
	a neutron star must have a non-axisymmetry in the crust. 
	The radiation amplitude is proportional to the crucial parameter $\epsilon$, 
	the fractional asymmetry that is proportional to the mass of the bump on the surface.\\
	As neutron stars emit electromagnetic radiation, 
	it is possible to target searches of GWs for neutron stars with positions, 
	frequencies and spin-downs known from X-ray, radio and gamma-ray observations. 
	Examples are the Crab and Vela pulsars. 

	Continuous GWs have not yet been detected, 
	but current searches have produced upper limits for their emission. \\
	Upgraded interferometers in LIGO could set an upper limit on  
	$\epsilon$ of order $10^{-6}$ for sources at $\sim10$ kpc, 
	and explain how a neutron star can be distorted to give a value of $\epsilon$ that is interesting as a GW source. \\
	Whatever the mechanism generating the distortion, 
	it is clear that  $\epsilon$ will be small,
	so that $h \sim 10^{-24}$ or smaller, which is quite weak. \\
	Measuring these waves will require
	coherently tracking their signal for a large number of wave cycles, 
	which is actually quite difficult, 
	since the signal is strongly modulated by the Earth’s rotation and orbital motion.

	Searching for periodic GWs means demodulating the motion of the detector, 
	a computationally intensive problem since the modulation is different for every sky position. 
	Unless one knows in advance the position of the source, 
	one needs to search over a huge number of sky position "error boxes”.

\subsubsection{Stochastic background}

	Stochastic backgrounds are “random” GWs, 
	arising from a  number of sources that overlap 
	in time and frequency that are not individually resolvable. \\

	The sum of the signals at any given time and frequency will have 
	a random pattern that may be analyzed statistically but not predicted precisely. \\
	A particularly interesting source of stochastic waves is the dynamics of the early Universe, 
	which could produce an all-sky GW background, 
	similar to the cosmic microwave background. \\
	However, to measure waves from this epoch, 
	we would need much more sensitive detectors than the ground-based interferometers available.
	
	Stochastic backgrounds are usually idealized as being stationary, 
	isotropic and homogeneous and because of their random nature they look just like noise.	\\
	Another possible background could come from astrophysical sources. 
	These possible sources include a population of rotating neutron stars 
	and a population of white dwarf binaries that would be important mostly for a space-based interferometers such as LISA

\chapter{Data Analysis for Coalescing Binary Systems}

	The main role of data analysis in gravitational wave detection is to extract the GW signal 
	buried into noisy interferometric strain data, which can be characterised by a spectral strain sensitivity.
	The data analysis technique depends on the type of source.
	GW searches from the inspiral, merger and ringdown phases of compact binary systems 
	are based on two broad techniques: 
	modeled searches which use theoretical waveforms for such systems 
	as predicted by general relativity and 
	unmodelled or burst searches which assume minimal information about these waveforms. \cite[p. 2] {bar}
	Although signals from coalescing binaries will most probably not stand above the broadband noise of the detector, 
	their detection is possible by the use of matched filtering, 
	which takes advantage of the fact that the wave form can be fairly well predicted. 

	This technique is the optimal detection strategy in Gaussian noise 
	in searching for gravitational waves with well understood waveforms. \cite[p. 2] {bar} \cite[p. 2] {bar}


\section{Matched Filtering}

	The filtering procedure involves correlating the detector output 
	with a copy of the expected waveform, 
	called a matched filter or a template.
	A real detector functions only over a finite frequency band, 
	and acquires data at a finite sample rate. 
	In this case, the noise power spectrum $S_n$ 
	may be taken to be infinite outside the bandwidth of the instrument, 
	effectively restricting the range of integration to lie between $[-f_N, f_N]$, 
	where $f_N$ denotes the Nyquist frequency $f_N = 1/(2\Delta t)$, 
	and $\Delta t$ is the time between successive data samples.   \cite[p. 2] {bar}

	The measured detector’s strain amplitude, $s(t)$, may or may not contain a signal,
	thus it will be composed of $n(t)$, the real strain-equivalent noise
        produced by fluctuations within the detector and its environment, 
	and possibly a gravitational wave of known form, $h(t)$
        
                \begin{equation}
                        s(t) = h(t) + n(t)
                \end{equation}
	
	or if there is no signal   		

		\begin{equation}
                        s(t) = n(t)
                \end{equation}
	
        assuming that the detector noise is well described as stationary Gaussian noise with zero mean and one-sided PSD, $S_n(f)$, given by Equation in Section.

        The aim of the match filtering is to look for a filter function,
	whose output, when passing the data through this filter, 
	will be large when a signal is present and small otherwise. 
        If the waveform, $h(t)$, embedded in stationary Gaussian noise is known, 
        the optimal filter, $K(t)$, has the following form

		\begin{equation}
 			K(t) = \tilde h_{template}/S_n
		\end{equation}

	where $\tilde h_{template}$ is the waveform template to match the signal.
	The output of the filter is obtained from a weighted inner product in the frequency domain, 
	cross-correlating the data with the inverse noise power weighted data from each of the detectors:

		\begin{equation}
 			(s|h)(t) = 4Re \int^{f^{high}}_{f^{low}} {{\tilde s (f) \tilde h^{*}_{template}(f)} \over {S_n (f)}} e^{2 \pi if} 
		\end{equation}

	The frequency limits $f_{low}$ and $f_{high}$ are determined by the bandwidth of the detector’s data.

	Here $\hat s(f)$ denotes the Fourier-transformed detector data, defined by

		\begin{equation}
			\hat s(f) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} s(t) e^{-2i \pi tf} dt
		\end{equation}

	and $\tilde h(f)_{template}$ denotes the Fourier-transformed template waveform 
	and $S_n(f)$ is the one-sided power spectral density of the detector noise. 
  
\subsection{Signal to noise ratio}

	Finding the form of the filter which will optimally extract the signal from the noise,
        means locating the maxima of the output of the matched filter, $(s|h)$, 
	over the arrival time and phase.
        This quantity, $(s|h)$, could be used to set a threshold value such that 
	a $|(s|h)|$ above the threshold would indicate a signal
	and below would indicate no signal. 
	However, the filter output can be normalized by the variance of the optimal filter, $\sigma^2$,
	which is an estimation of the uncertainty in a measurement of $(s|h)$, due to noise in the detector:

                \begin{equation}
                        \sigma^2 =4 \int^{\infty}_{0} {{|\tilde h_{template}(f)|^2} \over {S_n(f)}}df
                \end{equation}

 	The normalized output of the optimal filter is a new thresholding statistic and can be defined as  
	the signal to noise ratio (SNR), the ratio of the observed filter output to its,
        expected or observed, root-mean-square fluctuations:

                \begin{align}
                        \rho(t) &= {{| (s|h) |} \over {\sigma_{h}}} \\
                             &= {{(\tilde h_{template}|\tilde h)} \over {\sqrt{(h_{template}|h_{template})}}}
                \end{align}

        The value of the SNR will then be proportional to the amplitude of the signal buried in the noise.
	The smart choice for a threshold that can be set on this value is such that
	it can admit as many signals as possible, while still keeping the false alarm rate low. 

\subsection{Matched Filtering for Compact Binary Signals}

	An interferometric detector is sensitive to a linear combination 
	of the two gravitational wave polarizations where the gravitational wave signal has the form: 

                \begin{equation}
                h(t) = F_{+}h_{+} (t) + F_{\times}h_{\times}(t)
                \end{equation}

	where $F_{+}$ and $F_{\times}$ are the two antenna response functions of the detector, 
	which depend on $\theta$ and $\phi$, 
	the spherical coordinates of the sources sky position with respect to axes defined by interferometers’ arms. 
	Due to the nature of GW signals from the inspiral phase of CBCs, 
	it follows that the phase evolution of the cross polarization is $\ang{90}$ out of phase with the plus polarization, given by 

		\begin{equation}
			h_{+}(t) = A(t) cos (\phi (t))
		\end{equation}

		\begin{equation}
			h_{\times}(t) = A(t) sin (\phi (t))  
		\end{equation}
	
	where $A(t)$ is the amplitude evolution of the signal 
	and $\phi(t)$ is the phase evolution of the signal. 
	The Fourier transform of the two polarization are related by $\tilde h_{+} = ih_{\times}$, 
	which means that the inner product between the orthogonal polarisation is zero 

		\begin{equation}
			(h_{\times}|h_{+}) = 0
		\end{equation}
 
	Hence, when filtering  $s = (Xh_{+}/\sigma_{h}) + (Y h_{\times}/\sigma_{h}$ 
	with the template $h_{+}$ and $h_{\times}$, 
	respectively, we obtain the matched-filter real-time series
 
		\begin{equation}
			z_{+} = X\sigma_{h}
		\end{equation}

		\begin{equation}
			z_{\times} = Y \sigma_{h} 
		\end{equation}

	Which leads to the definition of the two-phase filter, 
	which has twice the degrees of freedom of a single-phase filter:

		\begin{equation}
			\rho = {1 \over \sigma_h} \sqrt{|z_{+}| ^2+ |z_{\times}|^2}
		\end{equation}

	The bonus of extracting information from both polarizations of the GW 
	comes with the cost of increasing the expectation value of $\rho$ when there is no signal present. 
	For a detector output that includes a signal at distance $D_eff$, 
	$s(t) = n(t) + (D_eff/1 Mpc)^{-1}h_{1Mpc}$, 
	a biased estimate of the effective distance for a given trigger 
	can be defined by combining the definition of the SNR with the template normalization $\sigma_h$:

		\begin{equation}
			\hat D_eff = {{\sigma_h} \over {\rho}}
		\end{equation}

	In reality, the parameters of astrophysical systems will not be known a-priori, 
	and searches must therefore be sensitive to signals at any location in the parameter space. 
	Performing the matched-filter calculation at every point in the full parameter space 
	would be extremely computationally prohibitive, 
	and therefore a number of analytic approximations are used to reduce the size of the parameter space. 
	It is assumed that the “extrinsic” parameters of a GW signal, 
	such as the sky-location, source orientation, polarisation phase and distance, 
	can all be absorbed by applying a constant phase-shift, 
	constant time-shift and a constant amplitude scaling to the observed waveform. 
	With these assumptions in place, 
	one can analytically maximise over an overall amplitude and phase of the signal, 
	and use an inverse Fourier transform to quickly evaluate the statistic as a function of time. 
	The component masses and spins, 
	which are the only intrinsic parameters, 
	are searched over by repeating the search process with a well chosen discrete set of waveform models 
	with varying values of the component masses and spins, 
	known as the template bank. 
	Physically, these assumptions hold if one assumes that the sources being observed 
	have no orbital eccentricity, no precession and no contribution from higher-order modes 
	to the gravitational-wave signal. 

%	The matched filter is the optimal linear filter technique to extract a know signal from a gaussian stochastic noise. 
%	Since the gravitational wave emission from binary coalescence is pretty well modelled, 
%	the matched filtering is the natural choice. However some complications arise: 
%	the detector background is neither stationary nor Gaussian and the knowledge of the signal 
%	is not perfect because the waveforms are approximated up to a given order 	
%	and the model parameters of the incoming wave are unknown. 
%	
%	Consistency checks, such as the $\chi^2$-test, 
%	are needed to discriminate true events from broadband transients 
%	of instrumental or environmental origin. 
%	To reduce the effects of the non-stationarities, 
%	vetoes can be defined to reject triggers on the base of the detector behaviour 
%	which is analysed by monitoring channels. 
%	To overcome the issues related to the unknown parameters, 
%	template banks are built covering the parameter space with a given accuracy and 
%	the filter output is computed summing in quadrature the filter outputs that involved two orthogonal-phase templates. 
%	Different approximations can be chosen to obtain waveforms as close as possible to the expected signals, 
%	with different post-newtonian orders and involving more parameters, 
%	for instance, the spin of the single components and the orbital eccentricity. 
%	Taking into account an higher number of parameters corresponds to an increment of the parameter space dimension 
%	and a growing up of the number of templates required to cover effectively the space. 
%	At the end, more templates generate more false alarms, 
%	therefore the pursuit of the best compromise between the efficiency in extracting signals 
%	and the false alarm rate is the final goal of a search. 

%\section{Matched Filtering}
%	
%	Matched filtering technique is the standard filter choice when the expected signal is known. 
%	The technique is based on evaluating the phase-coherent correlation between the data 
%	coming from the detector and a bank of template, 
%	a copy of the model waveform weighted down by the expected power spectral density of the data, 
%	that must reproduce the expected signal. 
%	Each template of the bank is produced starting from a set of continuous waveform parameters, 
%	the amplitude, the masses $m1$, $m2$, and spins of the binary system objects and a fiducial reference time 
%	(taken to be either “time-of-arrival” $t_0$ or “epoch-of-coalescence” $t_C$) and the corresponding orbital phase $\phi_0$. 
%
%	The parameters describing the inclination of the binary orbit and 
%	the location of the source on the sky are degenerate with other parameters, 
%	and are therefore, ignored in the search problem, 
%	although they can be deduced once the response of three or more non-colocated detectors 
%	to a gravitational wave event is known. 
%	The eccentricity may also be ignored, since it is expected to be negligible 
%	(due to orbital circularisation) by the time the gravitational radiation enters the frequency band 
%	(10-1000 Hz) of a ground-based detector. 
%	Therefore, once the waveform equation is chosen, 
%	with a given approximation and up to a given order, 
%	the bank can be considered as a collection of points that span the parameter space.
%	
%	How can a signal be taken optimally out of the noise? 
%	The assumption so far was that if a signal is present h(t) is known, 
%	then the part of the detector’s output that contains the signal leads to 
%	an integral that grows, whereas integrating a single template against the noise doesn’t grow as fast, it is oscillatory.
%	However, integrating the detector output against some h(t), 
%	it is not an optimal thing because the properties of our detector are not taken into consideration. 
%
%	The optimal procedure is obtaining a filter to integrate against the data knowing how the detector’s output in terms of noise looks like. 
%	Instead of integrating the data against waveforms, a generic filter that is going to be integrated against the noise can be defined as:
%		
%		\begin{equation}
 %		\hat s = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} dt s(t) K(t)
%		\end{equation}
%
%	The expectation value of $\hat s$, when a signal $h(t)$ is present, is obtained simply by integrating against the probability of noise realisations
%
%		\begin{equation}
%		S = \langle s \rangle_{h}
%		\end{equation}
%
%	while $N$, the root-mean-square value when no signal is present, is defined as:
%
%		\begin{equation}
%		N = \langle \hat s^2 \rangle_{h=0} - \langle \hat s \rangle^2_{h=0}]^{1/2}
%		\end{equation}
%
%\subsection{Signal to noise ratio}
%
%	The ratio $S/N$ is by definition the signal to noise ratio, SNR, 	
%	and is the expectation value of this filtering integral in the event that the signal is present, 
%	divided by its root-mean-square value, when no signal is present.
%	The filter is going to depend from the signal and therefore, 
%	from its strength and also from the properties of the detector, 
%	and whatever the noise curve was during the data taking time. 
%	The SNR will depend on the observation time and also the length in time of signal, 
%	if one is going to be present in the detector, 
%	on the properties of the detector during the data taking time and 
%	it will depend on the kind of signal templates that one has to its disposal. 
%	The knowledge of the kind of signal that is going to be extracted is limited,  
%	if the search focuses on a signal from a compact binary coalescence, CBC, 
%	it’s evident that the waveform is not exactly known because the two-body problem in GR 
%	has no exact solution; the signal will be approximated to some level.
%	The integration is not simply against some trial waveform, 
%	because some informations about the detector as well have to be combined into the research. 
%	Given that kind of expected signal, 
%	given the kind of operating detector and the length of the data taking, what choice of a filter maximises the SNR?
%
%	A more convenient form to write S and N is the Fourier domain: 
%
%		\begin{align}
%		S &= \langle \hat s \rangle_h \\
%   		&= \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} dt \langle s(t) \rangle  K(t)\\
%   		&= \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} dt h(t) K(t)\\
%  		&= \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} df \tilde h(f)\tilde K^{*}(t)
%		\end{align}
%
%		\begin{align}
%		N &=[ \langle \hat s^2 \rangle - \langle \hat s \rangle ^2]^{1/2}_{h=0} \\
%      		&= [\langle \hat s^2 \rangle  ]^{1/2}_{h=0} \\
%   		&= [\int^{\infty}_{-\infty} dt \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} dt \prime <n(t)n(t \prime)> K(t) K(t\prime)]^{1/2}\\
%   		&= [\int^{\infty}_{-\infty} df {1 \over 2} S_n(f) |\tilde K(f)^{*}|^2]^{1/2}
%		\end{align}
%
%	Since the filter is just a function of time, it knows nothing about the noise, 
%	the expectation value is acting only on s(t), 
%	and this is what gets integrated against the probability density over noise realisation.
%
%	Here we have assumed that a signal is present, so s(t) is really
%
%		\begin{equation}
%		s(t) = n(t) + h(t)
%		\end{equation}
%
%	Where n(t) is the noise but, the initial assumption is stationary gaussian noise, 
%	the expectation value of n(t) is zero.
%	Therefore, the expectation value of s(t) is just h(t), the expected signal. 
%
%
%	So far, we have arrived at
%
%		\begin{equation}
%		{S \over N} = {{\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}df \tilde h(t) \tilde K(t)^{*}}\over{ [\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}} df {1 \over 2} S_n(f) |\tilde K(f)|^2]^{1/2}}
%		\end{equation}
%	
%	This expression can be simplify by defining an inner product of two function of time:
%
%		\begin{align}
%		(A|B)  &= Re \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} df {\tilde A(f)^{*} \tilde B(f)}\over{1 \over 2 S_n(f)} \\
 %      		       &=4Re \int^{\infty}_{0} df {\tilde A(f)^{*} \tilde B(f)}\over {S_n(f)} 
%		\end{align}
%
%	And this allows to rewrite the SNR as
%
%		\begin{equation}
%		{S \over N} = {{(\textbf{K}|h)} \over {(\textbf{K}|\textbf{K})^{1/2}}}
%		\end{equation}
%
%	One step further is defying the normalised K
%
%		\begin{equation}
%		\textbf{\~ K} = {{\mathbf{K}} \over {{(\mathbf{K}|\mathbf{K})^{1/2}}}}
%		\end{equation}
%
%	Maximizing the SNR is equivalent to making K point in the same direction as h, 
%	that means that K has to be proportional to h:
%	
%		\begin{equation}
%		\mathbf K \propto h
%		\end{equation}
%
%	Meaning that the optimal filter is defined as
%	
%		\begin{equation}
%		\tilde K (f) \propto {{\tilde h(f)} \over {S_n(f)}} 
%		\end{equation}
%	
%	Submitting back into the expression for SNR gives the highest SNR one can attain:
%
%		\begin{align}
%		{S \over N} & = {{(\mathbf{K} | h)} \over {\sqrt{(\mathbf{K} |\mathbf{K})}}}  \\
 %           		    & = {{(h | h)} \over {\sqrt{(h |h)}}} \\
%	    		    & = sqrt{(h|h)}
%		\end{align}
%
%	In practice, the expectation value of S is not known, only the actual detector output s(t) is, 
%	so in signal processing the following approximation is made
%
%		\begin{equation}
%		({S \over N })_i \simeq {{(h_i|s)} \over {sqrt{(h_i|h_i)}}}
%		\end{equation}
%
%	The waveforms are characterise by source parameters: 
%	$\bar \theta = {\theta_1, \theta_2…,\theta_N}$ i.e. masses, spins, sky position.
%	In the SNR formula, instead of the expectation value we put the detector’s output and then
%	maximise this over all parameters: we are going to take the data and use the optimal filter 
%	for many different choices of the parameters. 
%	In practice this maximum value cannot be taken in a continuous way, 
%	the parameter space can only be sampled in a discrete manner: template banks.
%

\section{Template Bank}


	To perform a matched-filtered search that would recover any CBC system 	
	with minimal loss in SNR over a given range of intrinsic parameters 
	one must filter the data against a a bank of templates, 
	to obtain an estimation of the parameters for the source of the signal 
	from the template that provided the largest SNR.
	

	The manifold of waveforms is a continuous space in the component masses, 
	of which we are only able to search discrete points, 
	which have to be placed in such a way that any signal
	that has parameters in the space will still produce an SNR 
	above threshold by matching with the “closest” template. 
	In order to compute the distance between two templates of different parameters, 
	one can create a metric over the parameter space and then compute the the error between the two waveforms.
	Two neighbouring templates can be defined as $\hat h(f;\lambda)$ and $\hat h(f;\lambda + \Delta \lambda)$,
	where $\lambda = \{\lambda_{intr}, \lambda_{extr}\}$ is the a set of 
	the intrinsic (masses and spins) and extrinsic parameters (time of arrival and phase).
	Using the overlap of two waveforms, defined as the inner product inversely weighted 
	by the one-sided PSD $S_n(f)$ of the detector noise, one can compute the match:

		\begin{equation}
			\mathcal{M}(\lambda, \Delta \lambda) \equiv max_{\Delta \lambda_{extr}} \langle\hat h(f;\lambda), \hat h(f;\lambda + \Delta \lambda)  \rangle
		\end{equation}

	The match is maximised only over the extrinsic parameters, 
	because waveforms related by time and phase offsets
	are described by the same template, 
	since all possible coalescence times and phases are searched for.
	This expression can be Taylor-expanded about $\Delta \lambda = 0$:

		\begin{equation}
			\mathcal{M}(\lambda, \Delta \lambda) \simeq 1 - g_{ij} \Delta \lambda^i \Delta \lambda^j
		\end{equation}

	Where 

		\begin{equation}
			 g_{ij} \equiv -{1 \over 2} ({{\partial^2\mathcal{M}} \over {\partial  \Delta \lambda^i  \partial. \Delta \lambda^j}})_{\Delta \lambda = 0}
		\end{equation}

	can be interpreted as a metric in the parameter space, which is also defined
	by the mismatch $MM = (1 − \mathcal{M})$ between two templates.
	Any mismatch between signal and template leads to a loss in SNR, 
	and down-weighting by the signal-based vetoes. 
	When constructing a template bank, this mismatch can be also interpreted 
	as the proper distance in the parameter space,	

		\begin{equation}
			ds_{ij}^2 = 1 − \mathcal{M} = g_{ij} \Delta \lambda^i \Delta \lambda^j
		\end{equation}

	which should be chosen so that the loss in signal-to-noise ratio due to the mismatch 
	of the template with the signal does not deprecate the detectability of these sources.
\subsection{Template placement}


	The computational cost of any gravitational wave search
	 is directly proportional to the number of templates used.
	It is therefore vital to have a method that enables one 
	to place a template bank using as few templates as possible. 
	Two broad classes of template-placement algorithms 
	have been developed in the literature. 

\subsubsection{Stochastic placement}

	Stochastic methods place templates, 
	that are randomly drawn from an initially chosen distribution, 
	at random points in the parameter space.
	The bank is gradually built by comparing the newly drawn waveform
	with previously accepted templates, 
	and keeping only the ones that are sufficiently far away 
	from the ones the bank already has.
 	Those that are too similar to at least one existing waveform are discarded.
	This procedure continues until the pre-set convergence threshold is reached, 
	resulting in a final saturated template bank.
	The threshold is measured from the the ratio of rejected templates over the total number of template candidates.
	Stochastic placement, however, has the shortcoming that 
	a large number of trial waveforms needs to be drawn before convergence is achieved 
	(much more than the required number of templates in the bank). 
	This method also tends to over-cover the parameter space, 
	in the sense that the average template density is higher than optimal at fixed minimum match.
	Furthermore, the construction of a stochastic template bank 
	can be computationally demanding since, in principle, 
	each new proposed template needs to be compared 
	with previously chosen templates. 
	This problem becomes particularly acute 
	the closer the bank gets to saturation. 
	The computational problem also becomes especially demanding 
	when precession effects are considered as these additional degrees 
	of freedom require a large number of templates. 
	It is therefore important to consider methods of optimising a template bank, 
	specifically finding ways of improving effectualness for a given number 
	of templates and reducing the computational cost. 

\subsubsection{Geometric placement}


	A different method to construct the bank is geometric placement:
	this means building a flat, linear space in such a way that embeds the space of physical waveforms. 
	Hence, a crucial point is to identify a set of coordinates 
	in which the parameter space metric is almost constant: 
	the Euclidean distance in this space coincides with the matched-filtering overlap 
	between waveforms, making these coordinates naturally suited to define a regular lattice. 
	The minimal match determines the choice of spacing of the discrete template parameters 
	and therefore the number of discrete templates in the family.
	The most significant drawback of such banks is the amount of fine-tuning required 
	in order to cover “holes” across local patches because of the misalignment 
	of the cells arising from the variation of the metric. 

\subsubsection{Hybrid placement}

	In practice, a combination of the two methods is often a better strategy. 
	For example, one can place templates geometrically at low masses 
	and stochastically at high masses, or one can use many small patches 
	with regularly spaced templates, which are themselves placed stochastically 
	to cover the entire parameter space. 

\subsubsection{Compact Binary Spin}

	An observed GW signal from CBC is a powerful tool, 
	that can be used to estimate the parameters of the merging binary,
	which can then provide information about the formation processes of the system. 
	However, the processes which lead to compact binary formation  
	depend sensitively on a number of poorly constrained parameters, 
	such as the typical stellar metallicity at formation, 
	the distribution of supernova kicks, 
	and the binding energy of the common envelope. 
	There are two main channel through which compact objects can be formed:
	the coevolution of two massive stars in a binary and 
	the dynamical capture of two preformed compact objects 
	in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters.
	
	In particular, it is thought that compact binaries formed by dynamical capture 
	are more likely to have component spins
	at large angles to the orbital angular momentum, 
	while those formed by common evolution are more likely to have 
	spins that are nearly aligned with the orbital angular momentum.
	Present observations clearly indicate the potential for large spins 
	on black holes in binaries, possibly close to the Kerr limit $|S/m^2| = |\chi| = 1$.
	Very few measurements of the angles between the spins and 
	the orbital angular momentum exist from electromagnetic observations. 
	In some cases, one can measure this spin misalignment via GW emission, 
	as misalignment leads to precession of the orbital plane, 
	which appears as phase and amplitude modulations in the observed signal.

	Current searches for gravitational waves from CBCs largely focus on non-precessing systems.
	Including spin effects greatly increases the number of templates to be searched over, 
	and the search performs, on average, no better than non spinning searches, 	
	as the increased degrees of freedom in the signal space picked up extra noise, 	
	also increased the false alarm rate. 
	However, there might be astrophysical systems that are entirely missed by non-precessing searches. 
	Currently,  waveform models with spins aligned (or antialigned) with the orbital angular momentum 
	are being used in searches with Advanced LIGO, having been demonstrated that 
	aligned-spin templates pull in more signal than noise. 

	Detecting highly precessing systems offers a better chance to 
	disentangle the various parameters that describe the source,  
	breaking degeneracies that exist between physical parameters 
	in the emitted gravitational-wave signal.  
	This could allow a better understanding of the nature and origin of these systems.
	However, the effect of precession on the GW signal is not fully captured 
	by aligned-spin templates , and it remains to be seen whether 
	precessing-spin effects can be exploited to further improve the sensitivity of CBC searches. 
	

\section{Candidate Event Significance}


	To assign a statistical significance to detection candidates, 
	we need to measure the false-alarm rate of the search as a function of the detection statistic.
	Since it is not possible to isolate the detectors from gravitational waves, i
	t is impossible to directly measure the detector noise in the absence of signals. 
	This, together with the non-stationary and non-Gaussian nature of the noise, 
	means that the false-alarm rate of the search must be empirically measured. 
	This is done by applying a time shift to the triggers from one detector relative to another. 
	The minimum time-shift offset is chosen to be larger than the time-coincidence window 
	used to determine if signals are observed with consistent parameters in the network. 
	Events in the time-shifted analysis therefore cannot be due to the coincidence 
	of the pair of triggers produced by a real gravitational-wave signal. 
	Many time shifts create a large background data set which are used to 
	approximate the background noise and estimate the search’s false-alarm rate. 
	Since different templates in the bank can respond to detector noise in different ways, 
	the search background is not uniform across the template bank. 
	To maintain the sensitivity of the search to signals over a wide range 
	of masses under this non- uniform background distribution, 
	the search sorts both candidate events and background events into different classes. 
	The false-alarm rate of the search in each class is used to 
	assign a p-value to the candidate events; 
	a given candidate event is compared to the background events from the same class. 
	To account for having searched multiple classes 
	whose response is not completely independent, 
	the significance of candidate events is decreased by applying 
	a trials factor equal to the number of bins to obtain a final p-value 
	which describes the statistical significance of a candidate event. 

 
	Triggers from one detector are shifted in time
	 with respect to triggers from the second detector, 
	then the coincidence test is re-computed to create a background data set 
	that does not contain coincident gravitational-wave signals. 
	Repeating this procedure many times on a sufficiently large duration of input data 
	produces a large sample of false coincidences that are used to compute 
	the false-alarm rate of the search as a function of the detection statistic. 
	Under the assumptions that the times of transient noise artifacts 
	present in the data streams are not correlated between different detectors
	and that gravitational-wave signals are sparse in the data set, 
	this is a sufficiently accurate approximation of the background to support detection claims. 
	Our significance calculation requires that candidate events are statistically independent; 
	however, both noise transients and signals can generate many triggers across the template bank, 
	potentially yielding several correlated coincident events within a short time (1 second). 
	To generate independent candidates, the pipeline performs a final stage of clustering: 
	if more than one coincident event occurs within a time window of fixed duration,	
	typically 10 seconds, only the event with the highest detection statistic value,
	an identical clustering operation is also performed on the events in each time- shifted analysis. 
	Each candidate event is assigned a p-value that measures its significance. 
	For a candidate event with detection statistic $\rho$, its p-value p is the probability that the 
	there are one or more coincident noise events (false alarms) that have 
	a detection statistic value greater than or equal to $\rho$ . 
	We calculate p-values under the null hypothesis that all triggers seen are due to noise. 
	While this hypothesis might be unrealistic in the presence of loud signals, 
	we can never determine with complete certainty from gravitational-wave data alone 
	that any given trigger is due to signal rather than noise. 
	In order to claim detection it is necessary to show that the statistic values 	
	of events actually obtained in the search are highly improbable under such a null hypothesis: 
	i.e. that the p-value is very small. 
	Including all search triggers in the background calculation results in a self-consistent significance, 
	i.e. small p-values are assigned to random noise candidate events with the expected frequency; 
	the procedure also does not adversely affect the efficiency of the search 
	compared to other methods which aim to remove likely signal triggers before calculating the significance of search events. 
	Using the distribution of coincident events from the time shifts, we can measure 
	how many noise background events are louder than a given candidate event. 

\subsection{The lower frequency cutoff}

	The lower frequency cutoff $f_L$, which essentially determines the size of the parameter space 
	of chirptimes and plays a crucial role in the computational resources required 
	to process the data through the template bank. 
	The initial fiducial frequency $f_L$ defines the range of values of the chirptimes 
	and is not itself a parameter to search for. 
	However, it affects the length of the signals 
	(therefore, the parameter space to be covered) and the SNR extracted.
